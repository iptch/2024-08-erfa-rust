# Rust ERFA Hands-On

[![Built with Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/img/devbox/shield_galaxy.svg)](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/contributor-quickstart/)

## Setup

We use [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/) to manage dependencies. See their [installation
instructions](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/installing_devbox/) to install it. If you want to
integrate it with VisualStudio Code, see [their
plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jetpack-io.devbox)

### For Windows

If you want Rustlings to work correctly (used to solve the exercises), make sure that you use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to clone this repository and work on it.
Otherwise, you might run into issues with Rustlings not finding the exercise files and hot reloading your changes to the exercises.
